Mangler for Android will automatically (and without notification) send crash backtraces to our server. 
The backtrace data and your phone's IP address will be stored on our servers and will be publicly available. 
If you do not wish to send this information, you will not be able to participate in the alpha/beta process without building the package yourself.
